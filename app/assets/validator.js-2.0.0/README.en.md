## Example
```javascript
var example = {
      text: 'Hello world!',
      date: '2015-07-07',
      attachment: {
        name: 'note1',
        count: 1,
      },
      comments: null,
    },
    rules = {
      text: 'required|string',
      date: 'date|date_format:yyyy-MM-dd',
      attachment: {
        name: 'required|string',
        content: 'integer',
      },
      comments: 'array',
    };

console.log(Validator.validate(example, rules));
// => {status: 'failed', [{object: [Object], field: "comments", rule: "array"}]}
```

## Basic Usage

### Import validator.js library(for native JavaScript code)
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./validator.js"></script>
```
Or
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="./dist/validator.min.js"></script>
```

### Initialization(skip this if you are using native JavaScript code)

#### Node.js
```bash
npm install js-validator --save
```
```javascript
var validator = require('js-validator');
```

#### RequireJS
```javascript
requirejs(["./validator"], function(validator) {
  ...
});
```

#### Sea.js
```javascript
define(function (require, exports, module) {
  var validator = require('./validator');
  ...
});
```

### Make rules
You can have different rules for a single field, using `|` as the separator.
```javascript
var rules = {
  text: 'required|string',
  date: 'date|date_format:yyyy-MM-dd',
  comments: 'integer',
};
```
**About string escape**

When '|', ':' or ',' has to be in your rule's values, please add '\\\\' in front of them, just like this:
```javascript
var person = {
      nickname: 'Harry|Poter'
    },
    rules = {
      nickname: 'in:Harry\\|Potter,Hermione\\:Granger,Ron\\,Weasley'
    }
```

### Validate the rules
```javascript
// Validator.validate if you are using native JavaScript code
validator.validate(object_to_be_tested, rules);
```
**Result**

Return an object with 'status' and 'rejects' properties.

If the validated object meets all the rules, the 'status' property will be 'success' and the 'rejects' array will be empty; otherwise 'status' will be 'failed' and 'rejects' will contain details that causes the failure.

### Add a validator
You can use add() Function to add a validator, along with a name as its first argument and a validation method as second argument. Validation method can either be RegExp object or Function. When it's a Function, its first argument is the object to be tested, the second argument is the value of current validating field, and it should return `true` when the validation succeeded.
```javascript
// Validator.add if you are using native JavaScript code
validator.add('older_than', function (object, value, age) {
  return value > age;
});

var rules = {
  age: 'integer|older_than:17',
};
```

### Configuration
```javascript
// Validator.setConfig if you are using native JavaScript code
validator.setConfig({...});
```
### Available configurations

#### resumeOnFailed
**Default**: false

Whether the validation continues when it failed on any rule.
